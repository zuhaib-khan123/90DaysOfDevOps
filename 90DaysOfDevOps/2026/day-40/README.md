# Day 40 – Your First GitHub Actions Workflow

## Task
Today you write your **first GitHub Actions pipeline** and watch it run in the cloud.

This is the moment CI/CD stops being a concept and becomes real.

---

## Expected Output
- A workflow file: `.github/workflows/hello.yml`
- A markdown file: `day-40-first-workflow.md`
- Screenshot of your first green pipeline run

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Set Up
1. Create a new **public** GitHub repository called `github-actions-practice`
2. Clone it locally
3. Create the folder structure: `.github/workflows/`

---

### Task 2: Hello Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/hello.yml` with a workflow that:
1. Triggers on every `push`
2. Has one job called `greet`
3. Runs on `ubuntu-latest`
4. Has two steps:
   - Step 1: Check out the code using `actions/checkout`
   - Step 2: Print `Hello from GitHub Actions!`

Push it. Go to the **Actions** tab on GitHub and watch it run.

**Verify:** Is it green? Click into the job and read every step.

---

### Task 3: Understand the Anatomy
Look at your workflow file and write in your notes what each key does:
- `on:`
- `jobs:`
- `runs-on:`
- `steps:`
- `uses:`
- `run:`
- `name:` (on a step)

---

### Task 4: Add More Steps
Update `hello.yml` to also:
1. Print the current date and time
2. Print the name of the branch that triggered the run (hint: GitHub provides this as a variable)
3. List the files in the repo
4. Print the runner's operating system

Push again — watch the new run.

---

### Task 5: Break It On Purpose
1. Add a step that runs a command that will **fail** (e.g., `exit 1` or a misspelled command)
2. Push and observe what happens in the Actions tab
3. Fix it and push again

Write in your notes: What does a failed pipeline look like? How do you read the error?

---

## Hints
- Workflow files live in `.github/workflows/` and must end in `.yml`
- `uses: actions/checkout@v4` checks out your code onto the runner
- `run:` executes shell commands
- GitHub provides built-in variables like `${{ github.ref_name }}` for branch name
- Every push triggers a new run — check the Actions tab

---

## Documentation
Create `day-40-first-workflow.md` with:
- Your workflow YAML
- Screenshot of the green run
- What each `on:`, `jobs:`, `steps:` key does (your own words)

---

## Submission
1. Add `day-40-first-workflow.md` to `2026/day-40/`
2. Commit and push to your fork
